# Traveler Problem

## Purpose

The purpose of the Traveler Problem is to solve the challenge of finding the shortest route between two cities in a graph-based road network. This program demonstrates the use of efficient algorithms and data structures to navigate and process interconnected data, making it applicable to real-world problems such as routing and logistics.

## Accomplishments

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Modeled the road network using a dictionary, representing cities as nodes and roads as edges.

2. **Recursive Exploration**:
   - Implemented a recursive approach to explore all possible routes between the starting city and the destination.

3. **Avoiding Loops**:
   - Used a "visited" list to prevent revisiting cities, ensuring efficiency and correctness.

4. **Path Scoring**:
   - Measured the quality of each route based on the number of cities in the path (shorter paths scored better).

5. **LINQ for Optimization**:
   - Leveraged LINQ to sort and filter paths, identifying the shortest one efficiently.

6. **Result Validation**:
   - Verified the solution by printing the shortest route from Arizona to LA, demonstrating accurate results.
